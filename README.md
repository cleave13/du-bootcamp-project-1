## Purpose
The purpose of the app Team Awesome has created is to allow users to compare specific stocks to number of daily cases during this pandemic, hence the name StockDemic. The user can choose between the specified categories S&P, HealthCare, Energy, Financials, and Real Estate. You can also set up your own personal portfolio to make searching easier.

## Technologies Used
- Our team leveraged the [Polygon finance API](https://polygon.io/stocks?gclid=Cj0KCQiAmKiQBhClARIsAKtSj-lMPklMlg4c3Z4QpGpFS8pU141HabWIqXoP6mIJ8q9vSsT0yKtLH5oaAsjcEALw_wcB) to retrieve our financial data.
- All of the COVID data was sourced from the [Covid Act Now API](https://covidactnow.org/data-api).
- We leveraged the [Foundation CSS Framework](https://get.foundation/) for some of the prebuilt modal components and the framework for styling.
- All of our date manipulation was done using the [Day.js Javascript Library](https://day.js.org/).
